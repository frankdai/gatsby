Die casting process provides very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.  We have die casting equipment with hot chamber process up to 250 tons and cold chamber process up to 1,600 tons available which are suitable for most aluminum casting requirements with large quantity production of small to medium sized parts.   For critical aluminum die casting parts which require a higher quality finish and greater strength, we also have available gravity-fed die casting.   Additionally, we have complete machining capabilities for finished parts including tapping threads with various painting finishes such as powder-coated in wide range of colors.
