Metallor was established in April 2019 by Mr. Alfred E. Simmons and Mr. TD Cheng. We are a privately owned company with good financial standing.

Metallor is the pioneer to bringing the plumbing industry to Taiwan. Throughout the years, we have expanded our expertise from plumbing to other industries such as heating, air conditioning, pneumatic, fluid valves, conduit fittings, hardware, and electronics.  

Metallor is currently headquartered in Taipei with a branch office in Shanghai and sales offices in Hong Kong, Thailand, and New York. In addition, we have a total of seven inspection offices throughout our major manufacturing locations in Taiwan and China. 

Over the years, SIL has successfully established long-term relationships with several leading companies in specific industries, including many Fortune 500 companies.
SIL provides customers with a reliable supply-chain by linking customers and manufacturers on sourcing, product development, engineering, logistics, and quality systems.
